# Tester for package-plugin integration: Core

## Setup/Usage

You can use the bash scripts to setup the environment and run tests:

 - `recreate_env.sh`: (re-)create the virtual environment
 - `rebuild.sh`: (re-)builds the wheel file
 - `show_spiffy_dist_contents.sh`: Lists the contents of the distribution file. (Only makes sense to call after it's been built of course.)
 - `test.sh`: Runs the unit tests

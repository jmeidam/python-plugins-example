# Tester for package-plugin integration: a user

As a demonstration you can see this as a project that requires
`spiffy-plugin`. Note that as a user, I do not need to specify `spiffy-core`
as a dependency as that is implicit in using the plugin.

## Setup

To set up a virtual environment that makes use of spiffy, run
```
. ./setup_env.sh
```
